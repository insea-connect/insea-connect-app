## Motivation

INSEA Connect is born out of a passionate initiative to foster an open-source culture within INSEA, championing the philosophy of "developed by students, for students." This project not only aims to tailor a communication tool that meets the specific needs of our academic community but also serves as a platform for students to gain real-world software development experience. By involving students in the development process, INSEA Connect empowers them to create solutions that directly enhance their academic and social environment, fostering a cycle of learning, implementing, and improving. This hands-on approach ensures that the application continuously evolves and adapts, driven by the creativity and technical skills of the students it serves.
